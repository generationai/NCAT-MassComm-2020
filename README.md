# NCAT-MassComm-2020
This lesson uses a lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach to analyze customers' tweets with major airlines during the Covid-19 pandemic. The lesson is derived in-part from Ashwin Malshé's Sentiment Analysis from UTSA's contribution to the genAI Consortium. 

* Note: There are multiple versions of this lesson. The `use_version` is best for beginners in this area, while the `mod_version` is a great option if you'd like to expose students to R code and feel comfortable modifying code with small, guided changes. For a more ambitious approach involving text cleaning and creating visualizations yourself, consider the `create_version`. 

* All of the material for each lesson can be found in its respective folder above. The notes below pertain to the `use_version` of this lesson.


## Motivation and Essential Understandings

Data science is a field that crosses multiple disciplines.  Data scientists utilize many different methods and statistical techniques to gain knowledge and insights about data, including using text data for natural language processing. One such method is called Sentiment analysis.  The goal of this lesson is for students to gain exposure to the kinds of data that can be used with sentiment analysis and to think critically about how the data can be analyzed using a lexicon-based approach to this method. 

•	What is data science?

• What techniques do data scientists use to analyze data?

•	How can Sentiment/Lexicon Analysis be used to analyze customer perceptions?

## Context and Dataset

Many customers have differing perceptions of flying during the COVID 19 pandemic. The question is how to collect data regarding customer response to COVID 19 as well as what to do with data once it is collected.  Lexicon-based Sentiment Analysis is a method that applies a number value to words/phrases (lexicons) based on the positive or negative nature of the response. You will be guiding your students to understand and evaluate the use of Sentiment/Lexicon Analysis to analyze customer response data.


## Learning Objective
This lesson will introduce students to the application of sentiment analysis to customer perceptions or reviews.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

•	Describe the field of data science.

•	Describe what natural language processing is and how it might be used

•	Understand the use of Lexicon-based Sentiment Analysis to analyzing a structured dataset

•	Apply Lexicon-based Sentiment Analysis to a twitter dataset containing 100,000 tweets

•	Identify relationships between Lexicon-based Sentiment Analysis and the broader fields of AI / ML


## Analytical Concepts and Skills 

1.	Formulating hypotheses and Asking questions

2.	Analyzing and interpreting data 

3.	Using computational thinking

4.	Constructing explanations based on the analysis of data

## Target Audience

This lesson is geared towards undergraduate Students whose interest is in business, marketing, and mass communications. No prior knowledge is necessary for this lesson.


## Lesson Outline/Narrative

Time allotment: This lesson can be taught in one class period.
